simpleChar is a nice and beautiful charsystem, designed for servers, which are divided into factions, but it can also be used on servers with one faction.

Description

If you join the server or press F4, the character panel appears on your screen. You are able to create a character with your name. The team/job of this char will be set to the default job, which is set in the config. From now on any user, who has permissions to edit your character, can change your team, name, or money via the admin menu or a command. If the faction system is enabled, you can be trained by a faction member, who has permissions to execute “!train”. Your team then will be changed to the default team of the faction. Also you can enable only one faction, which is useful to train new players on a clonewarsrp server or militaryrp, if you enable more factions. A user, who has the permission to execute !invite, can invite you to their team. This means the server owner can give eg. regimental leaders the permission to invite players into their regiment. If the invited user executes in the next 60 seconds the command “!accept”, his team will be changed to the team of the player, who invited the user. The command “!jkick” kicks a player out of his job.&nbsp;The background seen in the pictures can be changed. Also, a CloneID system can be enabled. If enabled and if the team of the player should get an ID, a random ID is generated and add to the name.

All in all, this system grants yo a lot of possibilities, which leads to an great rp experience!

I showed you in the pictures just 5 different backgrounds, but the addon includes 13 different backgrounds. These backgrounds are suited for First Order Roleplay, Star Wars Roleplay and Military Roleplay. If you desire, you can also add new backgrounds by yourself or just contact me.
